					<h1>My Future</h1>
					<p class="future"><span class="summary">I am still unsure about exactly what I want to do in the future. I think my future career is likely going to be in either cybersecurity or as some type of embedded developer.</span> On one hand, I have seen first hand what working in cybersec for the defence force looks like, and I would love doing that as a job, however I have always dreamed of working on either the computer hardware or the firmware for some sort of robot that explores the ocean or space. I know its very unlikely I will get my dream job any time soon after I graduate, and Im also aware that my dreams may change by then, so I will see where my degree takes me.</p>
