							<h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
							<p>I first installed linux on a home PC when I was 12, and ever since then I have been trying to learn as much as I can about how computers work. Cybersecurity interests me because I love to explore stuff and play around to find how all the little parts interact with eachother. I like the way that cybersec forces me to really think about how all the little bits of a big abstracted system work together to make it function, and to pick apart those processes to find oversights in design. I also love picking locks!</p>

							<h1>Programming</h1>
							<p>I like programming because it lets me create whatever I want on a computer. I love having the ability to create something functional, visually impressive, or just fun and share it online or with my friends. I also love the challenge of starting from absolute scratch, and learning how to build something complex from the ground up, and having the ability to create my own servers and other networked stuff.</p>

							<h1>Robotics/electronics</h1>
							<p>I first experimented with robotics in my highschool robotics team. I was a member for several years and I grew to love managing the electronics and motors and writing software for the robot to make it drive, control its arms, and also see using sensors/act autonomously, as well as designing and 3d printing a couple of parts at home. I love the ocean and space and would like to make robots to explore them.
							I also enjoy computer hardware and architecture, and I hope to learn enough about it one day to build my own computer! (see: some progress on a virtual ALU in a very sophisticated electronics simulation software)</p>
